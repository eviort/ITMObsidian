I wanted to talk about unique alternatives of the Russian holiday "Maslenitsa" in different countries. 
The common name for this holiday is Shrove Tuesday. Unlike Russia, in most countries this holiday is celebrated a little earlier: for example, this year it's celebrated on 13 February. 

In Spain, the Shrove Tuesday is named "día de la tortilla": an omelette is made with some sausage or pork fat.

In Finland and Estonia, the day is called laskiainen (Vastlapäev) and is generally celebrated by eating green pea soup and a type of sweet roll called semla. The celebration often includes downhill sledging.

In Portuguese-, Spanish- and Italian-speaking countries, it is known as Carnival. It is often celebrated with street processions or fancy dress. The most famous of these events has become the Brazilian Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Venetians have long celebrated carnival with a masquerade.

In Germany, the day is known as Fastnachtsdienstag, or just Fastnacht Day. The last person up on Shrove Tuesday was called the "Fastnacht" and kidded all day long for being late for this wonderful breakfast and sleeping while the siblings enjoyed fresh fastnachts (similar to doughnuts) with a beverage. In some parts of Germany it is customary to celebrate Pancake Day by wearing veils, unusual outfits and special masks, usually made of wood.

In the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and some US states, this holiday is called Pancake Day. On this day, the English bake neat pancakes. They are most often eaten traditionally - warm, sprinkled with sugar and drizzled with lemon juice. Traditionally, many English housewives compete for the right to take part in the "pancake race" - a 400-metre race among women carrying a hot pan with a pancake, which should be tossed at least twice. The race starts at 11 a.m. when the church bells ring. The contestant who manages to toss and flip the pancake on the griddle the most times wins.

In Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island, small tokens are frequently cooked in the pancakes. Children like to discover the objects, which are intended to be divinatory. For example, the person who receives a coin will be wealthy; a pencil stub indicates that they will become or marry a teacher.

One way or another, all these holidays have one thing in common: shared joy, fun and delicious food.
